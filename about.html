<h3>My name is Chiyoung.</h3>
<br>
My day job is working as a VC at Cue Ball Capital in Boston. I'm
very lucky to be able to collaborate with so many interesting and
talented entrepreneurs every day.

Besides working in VC, I cook, mentor, craft leather goods, and
geek out about mechanical keyboards among many other things.
<br><br>
I want to make venture and entrepreneurship more accessible. To
that end, I do my best to mentor anybody who reaches out. I also
push out content that is focused around making venture capital more
transparent to others such as entrepreneurs and people looking to
break into the industry.
